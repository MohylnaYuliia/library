# library

For the task I used User and Book tables.
For these 2 table I used ManyToMany relations. This is because 1 user can have many books, and one book can have many users.

To test code please use library.postman_collection.json in Postman

I added User controller to show users that we can have in system.
For UserController and UserService I didn't use TDD. TDD was used only for stories.
